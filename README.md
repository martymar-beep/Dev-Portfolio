# Developer Portfolio – Margaret Martin

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This site showcases the web development projects I’ve completed as I transitioned into tech from a background in editing and education.

## 🚀 About

This responsive, accessible website was built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It's designed to highlight my skills, projects, certifications, and background in a clear, user-friendly way.

As a former writer, editor, and educator, I bring a strong eye for detail and communication — strengths that now support my debugging and frontend development work.

- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)
